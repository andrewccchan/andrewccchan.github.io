I am Chin-Cheng Chan, currently a research assistant at the Multimedia Processing
and Communications (MPAC) Lab led Prof. Homer Chen.
I received my Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan
University, Taipei, Taiwan. My primary research interests are image processing
and its applications to both natural and bio-medical images. Under the supervision
of Prof. Homer Chens since 2015, I have worked on different research topics,
including extracting blood vessels from optical coherence tomography data
 and developing robust algorithms for phase-detection autofocus. My recent research
 topics are reinforcement learning for autofocus and deep learning for medical images.
