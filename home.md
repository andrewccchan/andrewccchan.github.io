## About Me
I received my Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan in 2018. I joined Prof. Homer H. Chen's lab (the Multimedia Processing and Communications Lab) since my sophomore year (2015), and since then I have studied three research topics related to image processing.  

My first project is to study the applications of the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) algorithm. I quickly learned basic knowledge in convex optimization and grasped the idea of RPCA. Eventually, I used RPCA to extract blood  vessels from optical coherence tomography (OCT) data.  

Later, I conducted extensive research on improving the reliability of phase-detection autofocus (PDAF). I used my analytical skills to figure out the cause of the instability of PDAF and proposed three solutions---each addresses a problem that cannot be solved by the previous one.  

My current research project is to apply deep learning to the analysis of OCT images. I work interdisciplinarily with the Solid-state Laser Crystal and Device Laboratory at National Taiwan University, and I use the knowledge in both deep learning and OCT to quickly figure out the direction of research.

If you are interested in my research, please check out the [<u>Research</u>](/research) page for more information.
