I have joined Prof. Homer H. Chen's lab since my sophomore year (2015). Over the three years in Prof. Chen's lab, I have investigated three research projects, as listed below.

### [<u>Applications of robust principal component analysis (RPCA)</u>](/research/rpca)
**Aug. 2015---Jun. 2016**  
The sparse and low-rank model has achieved tremendous success in many image processing problems. In this project, I studied one such algorithm called the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and investigated its applications in image processing. I eventually applied RPCA to the extraction of blood vessels from optical coherence tomography data. I also proposed the short-time RPCA algorithm to reduce the false-positive rate of the extraction.

### [<u>Phase Detection Autofocus</u>](/research/pdaf)
**Sept. 2016---Jul. 2018**  
Autofocus, which enables sharp images to be captured automatically, plays an important role in many imaging systems. Phase detection autofocus (PDAF) uses the phase information of an image to assist autofocus, but the challenge is that the phase information is usually noisy. Therefore, the goal of this project is to improve the reliability of PDAF. I started from figuring out the principles of PDAF and eventually published three papers---each addresses a problem that cannot be solved by the previous approach---to combat the noise of the phase information.

### [<u>Deep Learning for Optical Coherence Tomography Image Analysis</u>](/research/dl_for_biomed)
**Aug. 2018---Present**  
Deep learning has succeeded in many problems in medical image analysis, yet it has not succeeded in the detection of skin cancer from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. In this project, we begin with studying the detection of the dermis-epidermis junction, which is usually the first part of the skin that a dermatologist looks for during diagnosis. The ultimate goal of the project is to design a deep-learning model that can perform automatic detection of skin cancer from OCT images. [<u>Read more</u>](/research/dl_for_biomed).
