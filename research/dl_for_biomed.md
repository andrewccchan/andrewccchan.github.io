    <p> Red curves represent the ground-truth DEJs, and green curves present the predicted DEJs. Each image in the video represents a cross-section of an OCT volume. </p>

This is my current research topic in Prof. Homer Chen's lab. To goal of the project is to use deep learning to detect the dermis-epidermis junction (DEJ) from 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) data. The DEJ is where a lot of skin diseases originate and is usually the first thing dermatologists look for during diagnosis. The algorithm I developed is able to accurately detect the DEJ as shown in the video clip above.
