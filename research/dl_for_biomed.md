Deep learning has succeeded in many problems in medical image analysis, yet it has not succeeded in the detection of skin cancer from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. In this project, we begin with studying the detection of the dermis-epidermis junction (DEJ), which is usually the first part of skin that a dermatologist looks for during diagnosis. The ultimate goal of the project is to design a deep-learning model that can perform automatic detection of skin cancer from OCT images.

The video clip above compares the ground-truth DEJs and the predicted DEJs, and we can see that the predictions are very consistent with the ground truth in most cases. The mean deviation between the ground truth and the predictions is 3.6 &mu;m (7.2 pixels). Based on the experiences I gained in this research, I am currently studying the automatic detection of skin cancer from OCT images.
